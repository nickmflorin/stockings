    /*
    Background:
    ----------
    The FontAwesome icon configuration works as follows:

    (1) The FontAwesome pro script is loaded via a <Script />
    (2) The script looks for <i> tags with the proper icon class name (i.e. fa-chevron-up) and
         nests an <svg> tag inside of the <i> tag, with the same attributes as the <i> tag (i.e.
         class name, style, etc.)

    This is done so that FontAwesome can *only* load the necessary CSS and SVGs for the icons that
    are actually used in the application.  This also means that it will only load the necessary CSS
    and SVGs for the icons that are defined when the elements are first rendered.

    Problem:
    -------
    What is the problem with this?  The problem is that it prevents icons from changing after the
    first render, particularly as it relates to user interaction.  If a component uses two different
    icons, where the second icon may not be shown until after the first render when the user
    interacts with the component, not only will the second icon not be loaded by FontAwesome
    initially - or at all - but the <svg> class name will indicate the original icon that was
    rendered, even if the <i> class name changes.

    For example, if we consider a button that toggles the icon between "chevron-up" and
    "chevron-down" when it is clicked, the HTML structure will exhibit the following behavior:

    // Before User Interaction & Before Font Awesome Loads
    <button>
      <i class="fa fa-chevron-up" />
    </button>

    // Before User Interaction but After Font Awesome Loads
    <button>
      <i class="fa fa-chevron-up">
        <svg class="fa fa-chevron-up" /> // This is responsible for rendering the actual Icon.
      </i>
    </button>

    // After User Interaction and After Font Awesome Loads
    <button>
      <i class="fa fa-chevron-down">
        <svg class="fa fa-chevron-up" /> // This is responsible for rendering the actual Icon.
      </i>
    </button>

    Note how after the user clicks the button, the class on the <i> tags changes appropriately (this
    is because our Icon component is responsible for that class name,  based on the 'icon' prop).
    However, the underlying svg class name does not change - this is because the svg is populated by
    FontAwesome when it first loads the script.  The resulting effect is that the actual icon that
    is rendered will not change - because the class on the <i> tag is only used by FontAwesome to
    define the class on the <svg> when it is initially rendered - but does not change the svg class
    name after the fact.

    Solution
    --------
    The solution to this problem is that when a component uses multiple icons and the icon may
    change after the first render, it has to render both of them - but apply "display: none" to the
    icon or icon(s) that are not currently being shown.  When the interaction occurs, such as a
    button click, the Icon component will then toggle which <i> element has the "display: none"
    style attribute.

    // Before User Interaction & Before Font Awesome Loads
    <button>
      <i class="fa fa-chevron-up" />
    </button>

    // Before User Interaction but After Font Awesome Loads
    <button>
      <i class="fa fa-chevron-up">
        <svg class="fa fa-chevron-up" />
      </i>
      <i class="fa fa-chevron-down" style="display: none;">
        // Style attribute is copied to the nested svg.
        <svg class="fa fa-chevron-down" style="display: none;" />
      </i>
    </button>

    However, since FontAwesome will copy all of the attributes on the <i> element to the nested
    <svg> element, when we remove or add the "display: none" tag on the <i> element, it will not
    have the same effect on the nested <svg>.  To fix this, we need to add "!important" to the
    "display: inherit" style on the <svg> element - ensuring that when the <i> element is hidden or
    shown, the nested <svg> element will also be hidden or shown - and since the <svg> is rendered
    in the DOM (but just hidden), the icon will appropriately change after user interaction occurs.

    // After User Interaction and After Font Awesome Loads
    <button>
      <i class="fa fa-chevron-up" style="display: none;">
        // Display none is still not inlined, but the important flag overrides.
        <svg class="fa fa-chevron-up" />
      </i>
      <i class="fa fa-chevron-down">
        // Display none is still inlined, but the important flag overrides.
        <svg class="fa fa-chevron-down" style="display: none;"/>
      </i>
    </button>

    display: inherit !important;
