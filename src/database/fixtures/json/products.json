They are used to make planks, chair parts, tool handles, shingles, basket splints, blanks for spoon carving, and more.  Lie-Nielsen Froes are designed by green wood            riving expert, Drew Langsner. Having split and rived stock for decades, Drew redesigned this traditional            tool with several key improvements.",
        "The blade width is less than on most antique examples. This is for improved leverage - handle length relative to blade width. The blade thickness is 3/8\" for adequate strength. The bevel angle of 30° is ideal for both soft and hard woods.",
        "Common Froes were typically made from one piece of steel, bent into a loop at one end to form a ferrule to receive the handle. However, the uneven shape of the ferrule made it difficult to secure a hand-carved handle            that wouldn’t work loose over time. Our Froe blades are welded to a cylindrical ferrule and have a            tight-fitting, turned handle secured with a stepped washer and large lag screw. They are built for longevity and durability.",

These saws are solid, well balanced and smooth cutting. Filed rip for cutting tenons, which is with the grain.",
        "We’ve redesigned our three most popular back saws to feature a slight tapering of the blade from toe to heel. This taper gives you better control over precise cuts. When you reach the gauge line on the front of your stock, the blade is slightly above the line on the back side, which reduces the risk of sawing past your line. In addition, the taper introduces an angled approach to your stock (when holding the saw back parallel to the bench), enabling faster cuts with less effort.",

        "We’ve redesigned our three most popular back saws to feature a slight tapering of the blade from toe to heel. This taper gives you better control over precise cuts. When you reach the gauge line on the front of your stock, the blade is slightly above the line on the back side, which reduces the risk of sawing past your line. In addition, the taper introduces an angled approach to your stock (when holding the saw back parallel to the bench), enabling faster cuts with less effort.",
        "Our Tapered Carcass Saw is patterned after our 14\" Carcass Saw with a thinner plate of .015\".",
        "It tapers ¼\" along the length of the blade, with a cutting depth of 2\" at the toe and 2-1/4\" at the heel. This combination of features yields a well-balanced saw that cuts extremely fast and precisely, with excellent surface finish.",
