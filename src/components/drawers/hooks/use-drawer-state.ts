/**
 * A hook that provides the means of managing the state of a drawer locally to the component,
 * with a dynamically loaded and conditionally rendered {@link ClientDrawer} component, rather
 * than declaratively through the {@link DrawerProvider} directly.
 *
 * Managing the open/closed state of a drawer can be done via the {@link DrawerProvider} directly,
 * and declaratively, as follows:
 *
 * ```tsx
 * import { useDrawers } from "~/components/drawers/hooks/use-drawers";
 *
 * const MyComponent = () => {
 *   const { open } = useDrawers();
 *
 *   return (
 *     <Button onClick={() => open("my-drawer-id", { my: "props" })}>
 *       Open Drawer
 *     </Button>
 *   );
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The problem with this, however, is that it requires us to import the 'useDrawers' hook, and all
 * of its associated mechanical, client-side only logic, into the component that needs to open the
 * drawer, regardless of whether or not the drawer is opened.
 *
 * This is not ideal - but, to offer a more reactive approach, this hook - when used in conjunction
 * with the {@link ClientDrawer} component, can be used to dynamically render a drawer component
 * when the drawer is opened, and to manage the state of the drawer locally to the component:
 *
 * ```tsx
 * import { useDrawerState } from "~/components/drawers/hooks/use-drawer-state";
 *
 * const ClientDrawer = dynamic(() => import("~/components/drawers/ClientDrawer"), {});
 *
 * const MyComponent = () => {
 *   const { isOpen, open } = useDrawerState({ drawerId: "my-drawer-id" });
 *
 *   return (
 *     <>
 *       <Button onClick={() => open()}>
 *       {isOpen && (
 *         <ClientDrawer id="my-drawer-id" props={{ my: "props" }} />
 *        )}
 *     </>
 *   )
 * }
 * ```

     rendered, that the "true" open state is set.  However, the events are used to keep the true
     open/closed state in sync with the local state here - so that the local state is also updated
     when the drawer is closed, allowing the locally managed <ClientDrawer /> to be reopened (and
     rerendered). */
